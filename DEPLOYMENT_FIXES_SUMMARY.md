# WishCraft Deployment Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve Railway deployment issues and ensure Built for Shopify compliance.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Railway Configuration Issues ✅
**Problem:** Multiple conflicting Railway configuration files causing deployment confusion
**Solution:**
- Removed conflicting `railway.json` file
- Updated `deploy/railway.toml` to use production-ready `Dockerfile` instead of `Dockerfile.simple`
- Ensured proper health check and resource configurations

### 2. Server Configuration Issues ✅
**Problem:** Using debug wrapper in production and missing security middleware
**Solution:**
- Updated `package.json` start script from `start-debug.js` to `server.js`
- Enhanced `server.js` with:
  - Helmet.js for security headers
  - Compression middleware for performance
  - Express rate limiting for DDoS protection
  - Morgan for request logging
  - Proper error handling and sanitization

### 3. Security Requirements for Built for Shopify ✅
**Implemented:**
- **HMAC Webhook Verification**: Already implemented in `webhook-security.server.ts`
- **Security Headers**: Added via Helmet.js with Shopify-specific CSP
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented with different limits for API, auth, and webhooks
- **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive security event tracking in `security-monitoring.server.ts`
- **CSRF Protection**: Added security headers for CSRF mitigation

### 4. Performance Monitoring ✅
**Implemented:**
- Built for Shopify performance monitoring service
- Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, CLS, INP, FCP, TTFB)
- Performance budget alerts
- Integration with web-vitals library
- Lighthouse CI configuration

### 5. Environment Variable Configuration ✅
**Created comprehensive templates:**
- `.env.production.template` with all required variables
- `.env.railway.example` for Railway-specific setup
- Deployment checklist with variable requirements

### 6. Database Configuration ✅
**Fixed:**
- Added SSL mode requirement (`?sslmode=require`) for Railway PostgreSQL
- Proper connection retry logic in Docker entrypoint
- Health check endpoint for database connectivity

## Files Modified

1. **deploy/railway.toml** - Updated to use production Dockerfile
2. **package.json** - Fixed start script and added security dependencies
3. **server.js** - Enhanced with security middleware and proper error handling
4. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Created comprehensive deployment guide
5. **deploy/fix-built-for-shopify.sh** - Created automated fix script

## Security Dependencies Added
- `helmet@^8.1.0` - Security headers
- `compression@^1.8.0` - Response compression
- `express-rate-limit@^7.5.1` - Rate limiting
- `morgan@^1.10.0` - Request logging

## OAuth Scopes
Verified minimal scopes required for gift registry functionality:
- `read_customers` - Read customer data for registry owners
- `read_orders` - Track registry purchases
- `write_orders` - Create orders from registry
- `read_products` - Display product information
- `read_inventory` - Real-time inventory sync
- `write_metaobjects` - Store registry data in Shopify

## Performance Targets (Built for Shopify)
- **LCP**: < 2.5s (target), < 3.0s (budget)
- **CLS**: < 0.1 (target), < 0.15 (budget)
- **INP**: < 200ms (target), < 300ms (budget)
- **FCP**: < 1.8s (target), < 2.5s (budget)
- **TTFB**: < 800ms (target), < 1.2s (budget)

## Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**
   - Use `.env.railway.example` as reference
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL includes `?sslmode=require`

2. **Deploy to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check health endpoints
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Test webhook functionality

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Set up performance webhook alerts
   - Monitor security events
   - Track Core Web Vitals

## Compliance Status

### Built for Shopify Requirements
- ✅ Security: HMAC verification, rate limiting, security headers
- ✅ Performance: Monitoring, compression, bundle limits
- ✅ Privacy: GDPR compliance, audit logging
- ✅ Quality: Error handling, health checks, testing

### Railway Deployment
- ✅ Proper Dockerfile configuration
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ SSL database connection
- ✅ Signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Monitoring Commands
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View environment variables
railway variables

# SSH into container
railway run bash
```

## Success Criteria
- No 502 errors on Railway
- All health checks passing
- Core Web Vitals within Built for Shopify thresholds
- Successful webhook HMAC verification
- Proper security headers on all responses
