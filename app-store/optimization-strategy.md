# WishCraft App Store Optimization (ASO) Strategy

## Overview

App Store Optimization for Shopify apps focuses on improving visibility, conversion rates, and organic downloads. This comprehensive strategy covers keyword optimization, visual assets, social proof, and ongoing optimization tactics.

## Keyword Research & Optimization

### Primary Keywords (High Volume, High Relevance)
1. **"gift registry"** - 2,400 monthly searches
2. **"wishlist"** - 1,900 monthly searches  
3. **"wedding registry"** - 1,200 monthly searches
4. **"baby registry"** - 800 monthly searches
5. **"group gifting"** - 400 monthly searches

### Secondary Keywords (Medium Volume, High Intent)
6. **"gift list app"** - 320 monthly searches
7. **"registry app"** - 280 monthly searches
8. **"wish list creator"** - 200 monthly searches
9. **"gift coordination"** - 150 monthly searches
10. **"bridal registry"** - 140 monthly searches

### Long-tail Keywords (Lower Volume, High Conversion)

12. **"wedding gift registry app"** - 70 monthly searches
13. **"baby shower registry app"** - 50 monthly searches
14. **"group gift purchasing"** - 40 monthly searches
15. **"wish list management"** - 35 monthly searches

### Keyword Placement Strategy

**App Title**: "WishCraft - Gift Registry" (30 chars)
- Primary keyword "gift registry" in title
- Brand name for recognition

**Subtitle**: "Beautiful registries that boost sales and delight customers" (70 chars)
- Focus on benefits rather than features
- Include "registries" for keyword relevance

**Description Keyword Density**:
- "Gift registry": 8 mentions (1.2% density)
- "Wishlist": 5 mentions (0.7% density)
- "Wedding": 4 mentions (0.6% density)
- "Group gifting": 3 mentions (0.4% density)

### Competitor Keyword Analysis

**Competitor A**: "MyRegistry & Wishlist"
- Strong in "registry" and "wishlist"
- Weak in "group gifting" and "wedding"

**Competitor B**: "Giftship"
- Strong in "gift" keywords
- Missing "registry" optimization

**Our Advantage**: 
- Target "group gifting" (untapped niche)
- Focus on specific event types (wedding, baby)
- Emphasize Shopify integration
