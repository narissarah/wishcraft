## 🚀 Conclusion

WishCraft has a solid technical foundation but requires significant compliance work before App Store submission. The current implementation demonstrates good functionality but lacks critical security, privacy, and integration requirements.

**Recommended Action**: Begin immediate implementation of Phase 1 critical compliance items. Success in addressing these issues will position WishCraft as a competitive gift registry solution in the Shopify App Store.

**Risk Assessment**: High risk of App Store rejection without addressing critical compliance issues. Medium risk of performance issues without proper testing. Low risk of technical functionality given current solid foundation.
