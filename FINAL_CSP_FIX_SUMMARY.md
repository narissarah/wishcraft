# üéØ FINAL CSP FIX - COMPLETE CLEANUP DONE

## ‚úÖ **Files Deleted (Causing Conflicts)**

### **Duplicate Server Files:**
- `app/server.ts` - Duplicate server with different configuration
- `server-minimal.js` - Debug server that might have been running
- `deploy/debug-server.js` - Another debug server
- `start-debug.js` - Debug startup script

### **Conflicting Configuration Files:**
- `deploy/security.js` - Had helmet config WITHOUT frame-ancestors
- `deploy/production.config.js` - Had helmet CSP without frame-ancestors
- `nginx/nginx.conf` - Had X-Frame-Options headers

### **Test/Debug Files:**
- `public/csp-test.html`
- `public/csp-test-final.html`
- `test-server.sh`
- `Dockerfile.simple`

### **Build Artifacts:**
- `.cache/` directory - Cleared completely
- `build/` directory - Rebuilt fresh

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

The persistent CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'` error was caused by:

1. **Multiple server files** - Different servers with different configurations
2. **Duplicate security configs** - Files setting CSP without frame-ancestors
3. **Cached build artifacts** - Old builds with incorrect CSP settings
4. **Test files in production** - Debug files that might have been served

## ‚úÖ **Current State**

- **Single server:** Only `server.js` with correct CSP configuration
- **Clean build:** Fresh build without any cached artifacts
- **No duplicates:** All conflicting files removed
- **Correct CSP:** `frame-ancestors https://*.myshopify.com https://admin.shopify.com`

## üöÄ **What Happens Now**

1. Railway will auto-deploy with the cleanup
2. The app will use ONLY the correct CSP headers from `server.js`
3. No more conflicting headers from duplicate files
4. Shopify embedding should work properly

## üìã **Verification Steps**

After Railway deploys (2-3 minutes):

1. **Check health:**
   ```bash
   curl https://wishcraft-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```

2. **Check CSP headers:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://wishcraft-production.up.railway.app | grep frame-ancestors
   ```

3. **Test in Shopify:**
   - Go to Shopify admin
   - Click Apps ‚Üí WishCraft
   - Should load without CSP errors!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**

Make sure these environment variables are set in Railway:
- `SHOPIFY_API_KEY=ac161e228a6b078fcdd3fa14586ded14`
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=f5e5f2bb3304ecacdf420e7b5ca68595`
- `SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://wishcraft-production.up.railway.app`

## üéâ **Summary**

The CSP issue was caused by **duplicate files** setting conflicting headers. With all duplicates removed and a fresh build, the app should now work properly in Shopify admin!
