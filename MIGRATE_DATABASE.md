# ðŸš€ Railway Database Migration Instructions

Your deployment is successful, but the database schema needs to be updated!

## Quick Migration (Recommended)

Run this single command to update your Railway database:

```bash
npm run db:deploy
```

This will:
- Connect to your Railway PostgreSQL
- Update the schema to match your latest changes
- Preserve existing data where possible

## Alternative: Step-by-Step Migration

If you prefer to see what's happening:

```bash
# 1. Check current database status
npx prisma db pull

# 2. Compare with your schema
npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma

# 3. Apply changes
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# 4. Verify
npx prisma studio
```

## Important Notes

- Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable points to Railway PostgreSQL
- The `--accept-data-loss` flag is safe for development but review changes for production
- Your recent schema updates include:
  - Registry collaboration features
  - Product sync improvements
  - Analytics enhancements
  - Performance optimizations

## After Migration

Your app should work perfectly with all the new features enabled!

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors:
1. Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
2. Ensure Railway PostgreSQL is running
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Check Railway logs for details

## SendBeacon Error

The SendBeacon error you're seeing is a client-side Shopify telemetry error and is not related to your database. It's safe to ignore.
